title: About Alex
---
I'm Alex. I'm a computational biologist at a biotech company called [Counsyl](https://www.counsyl.com/) in South San Francisco. I work on building new genetics tests using next generation sequencing and creating software pipelines to analyze clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. I'm most interested in developing novel techniques (when necessary) to call the most challenging classes of genetic variants. I'm also interested in emerging reference standards and regulations for NGS-based tests and the overall social issues of bioethics and patient access.

Since most of my work in biotech is closed source, at least for now, I'm putting modicum of effort into open-sourcing some of my personal projects and writing a couple sentences about each of them. Also, since all my projects at work are very serious and impactful, I've made an effort to be more light-hearted in my personal programming projects. I freely admit they are quite useless. 

I made this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), specifically the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme.  It's hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
